# MERN_ESTATE_project 
This is a Modern Real Estate Marketplace from Scratch with JWT authentication and a redux toolkit. In this Project, I have used the MERN stack - MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js along with Advanced Authentication: Implement JWT, Firebase, and Google OAuth with cookies for secure and seamless user access and implemented Real-world CRUD Operations: Create, read, update, and delete property listings using MongoDB.
